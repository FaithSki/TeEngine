I literally edited Base.java by copy-pasting all of the code into the version of Base.java in my Eclipse, worked on it,
and then hit the "edit" button in Github and copy-pasted all of my Eclipse code into the Github version. Then you just commit
it to the master branch.

I also changed Room.java. I guess it would be good for us both to keep a changelog on here??

also also if it doesn't let you directly edit the Master branch, I guess make your own branch?? maybe we can just share one
account if that happens.
